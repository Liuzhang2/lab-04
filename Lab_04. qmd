## Reproducible research

- When we say "reproducible research", what do we mean?

It means the idea that the results and findings of a research study can be accurately reproduced by others who follow the same methods and procedures outlined in the original study. It emphasizes the transparency and openness of the research process.

- What is the difference between the 'computing environment' and the 'project structure'?

The computing environment refers to the set of software tools, libraries, packages, and dependencies that are used to execute a particular piece of code or analysis. Project structure refers to the organization and layout of the files and directories within a research project. the computing environment focuses on the software and dependencies needed to run code, while the project structure deals with how files and components are organized within a research project. Both aspects are important for reproducible research, as they contribute to the transparency and ease of replication by others.

- How does Git and GitHub support reproducible research practices?

Git and GitHub play significant roles in supporting reproducible research practices by providing version control, collaboration tools, and a platform for sharing code and resources. Here's how they contribute to reproducibility.

## Project management

In the section "Project management", describe the process of forking, cloning, editing, committing, and pushing. 

Below my steps:

Go to the GitHub repository.
Click "Fork" to create a copy the account.
Clone the Forked Repository:

Open the terminal.
Use git clone to download the repository to the local machine.
Create a Branch for My Changes:

Navigate to the repository directory.
Create a new branch (e.g., "feature-branch").
Make and Edit Changes:

Open the project in my code editor.
Make the necessary changes.
Commit My Changes Locally:

Stage your changes.
Commit with a descriptive message.
Push Changes to my Fork.

## Assessing your progress
I have learnt how to fork, clone and commit in github and r studio. The challeaging is I couldn't distinguish the github and rstudio's different funtions.
